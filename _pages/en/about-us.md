Mission
-------

We want to create a new online-system for the **management and the long time storage of computer- and videogame-data**, which avoids the problems of other existing projects and is at the same time designed with innovation and sustainability.  

These are the characteristics of our system:

*   the **logical data model** will be comprehensive and therefore exceed the capabilities of any other existing game database.
*   the underlying technology will be based upon a **modern software architecture**, so everything is easy expandable and maintainable.
*   everybody (with the required skills) will be able to **extend and enhance the source code**
*   the gathered **data will be available to everybody**, from a technical point of view as well as regarding licensing conditions
*   **multilingualism** is a goal right from the beginning
*   a **nonprofit organisation** (instead of one ore more individuals) will be the operator of the database, to assure a **long term stability and availability**.
