## Open Registry Of Game Information (Oregami)


# Mission

We will create a new online system for the **management and long time storage of data about computer and video games** as well as the hardware and software needed to run them. This new system shall avoid the problems of existing projects while being designed for sustainability and maintainability.  


# Characteristics

*   a **logical data model** designed to hold all the available data about games, gaming companies, gaming people, gaming hardware, and the gaming press

*   a **modern software architecture** under the hood for easy expandability and maintainability

*   an **open source code** for every hacker to easily join the team

*   an **open approach to the data gathered**, from a technical point of view as well as regarding licensing conditions

*   **multilingualism** right from the beginning

*   a **non-profit organisation** (instead of one ore more individuals) as the legal base, to assure long-term stability and availability
