Who doesn't know the cool German gaming mags of the 80's and 90's? Power Play, Aktueller Software Markt, Video Games, Amiga Joker! 

At **Kultpower.de** there are thousands of scanned pages of these mags in a comprehensive database, interviews with former editors and much more to discover. 

In 2010 a new section of the site named "Kultpower Archive" was founded in order to hold complete scans of different issues of the mags. Meanwhile, over 100 complete issues can be explored.

## Other Game Databases


 [![MobyGames-Logo]({{ "/assets/images/mobygames_logo.png" | absolute_url }} "MobyGames-Logo")](http://www.mobygames.com){:target="_blank"}

**MobyGames** is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, video game documentation project at the Internet. The pages exist since 1999 and consist of comprehensive, very well analyzable information about more than 80,000 games on more than 200 platforms.

Because MobyGames is so old, many gaming experts have gathered there over the years and entered much information on older and obscure video games. That's why the interested user can, exemplary, take a deeper look into the colorful world of Japanese and Chinese video gaming. [www.mobygames.com]

As the name suggests, the **Online Games Datenbank** (OGDB) is a Internet database with the sole purpose of collecting, archiving and publishing numerous information about computer and video games.

This project was founded by the team of Blood-is-Red.de, a site dedicated to censorship in gaming, and offers currently information about over 45,000 games.

The database is aimed at German-speaking gaming enthusiasts and is designed to conveniently publish comprehensive information about game releases, their differences and traits, and censorship and youth protection in them. There is a powerful collection tracker included, too.

 [![Retrocollect-Logo]({{ "/assets/images/retrocollect_logo2.png" | absolute_url }} "Retrocollect-Logo")](http://www.retrocollect.com){:target="_blank"}

When compared to others in this list, **RetroCollect** is rather a new video game database, aimed mainly at collectors of console games.

The siteâ€™s founders tried to merge a PAL gaming database with a rarity guide, add some healthy editorial content like retro gaming news and reviews, and pack all that into a user-friendly and eye-pleasing webdesign. 

And they did quite achieve their goals. Meanwhile, RetroCollect has become a serious contender with lots of data within a sophisticated data model and a clear plan for the future.

The **IGDB** ("Internet Game Database") is a Swedish project trying to recreate the success of the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) for games.

The guys behind this site have scored some funding which enables them to work full time on it, so the development speed is astounding. They also made good connections to the gaming industry by introducing verified profiles for gaming professionals.

Promising indeed, and not just by the familiar naming, so let's see where this is headed!
