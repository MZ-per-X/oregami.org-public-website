The pages exist since 1999 and consist of comprehensive, very well analyzable information about more than 37,000 games on more than 125 platforms.

As the name suggests, the **Online Games Datenbank** (OGDB) is a Internet database with the sole purpose of collecting, archiving and publishing numerous information about computer and video games. This project was founded by the team of Blood-is-Red.de, a site dedicated to censorship in gaming. The database is aimed at German-speaking collectors as well as demanding or casual gamers, and is designed to conveniently publish comprehensive information about game releases, their differences and traits, and censorship and youth protection in them.

**RetroCollect** is a rather new, but promising effort of a video game database, aimed mainly at collectors. The site's founders tried to merge a PAL gaming database with a rarity guide, add some healthy editorial content like retro gaming news and reviews, and pack all that into a user-friendly and eye-pleasing webdesign. And they did quite achieve their goals. RetroCollect is a site to watch, definitely. [www.retrocollect.com](http://www.retrocollect.com){:target="_blank"}



 [![IGDB-Logo]({{ "/assets/images/igdb_logo.png" | absolute_url }} "IGDB-Logo")](http://www.igdb.com){:target="_blank"}

**IGDB** ("Internet Game Database") is a Swedish project trying to recreate the success of the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) for games. The guys behind this site seem to have scored some funding which enables them to work full time on it, so the development speed is astounding. They also made their first connections to the gaming industry by introducing verified profiles for gaming professionals. Promising indeed, and not just by the familiar naming, so let's see where this is headed!
