First things first: **You are part of the Oregami community!**  
We're not working in the dark, but are a community project where everyone can participate.  

The central place where the Oregami community lives is our [message board](https://forum.oregami.org){:target="_blank"}. Every discussion is publicly viewable, but those who want to participate need to [register](https://forum.oregami.org/ucp.php?mode=register){:target="_blank"}. 

Every registered user is allowed to post on the [board for open discussions](https://forum.oregami.org/viewforum.php?f=38){:target="_blank"}, but for posting on the boards with restricted editing rights manual activation is needed - but that's no big deal if you're showing some enthusiasm.
Hint: Bookmark [this board link](http://forum.oregami.org/search.php?st=90&sk=t&sd=d&sr=topics&search_id=active_topics){:target="_blank"} \- it shows the active threads of the last days!  

For the documentation of our concepts and ideas we use the software Confluence by [Atlassian](http://atlassian.com/){:target="_blank"}. Our Confluence wiki can be found under [oregami.atlassian.net](https://oregami.atlassian.net/){:target="_blank"}.  

If we work on our project - which is mostly in the evenings (CET) - we use to fire up [Discord](https://discordapp.com/){:target="_blank"} and chat in the [Oregami Discord channel](https://discord.gg/yXWjzXc){:target="_blank"}. 

News around our project are published regularly on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Oregami.org){:target="_blank"} and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/oregami_org){:target="_blank"}, longer versions of these news can often be found on [our blog](http://www.oregami.org/en).  

Interested programmers and web designers shall be warmly pointed to the information on the [developer page](http://www.oregami.org/en/developers.html).
