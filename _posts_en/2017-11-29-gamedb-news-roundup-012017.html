     <br />Let's take another look at some developments within the <strong>video game database landscape</strong>.<br /><br />(The  content in this update is a bit outdated, as this will be the last  GameDB News Roundup for the time being, because I want to concentrate  more on subject matter work to finally bring Oregami online, and  couldn't beat myself to publishing this earlier. If you want to continue  writing these contents, please get in touch <a href="https://forum.oregami.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=32956">at our forums</a>.)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.igdb.com/">IGDB.com</a> released version 2 of <a href="https://market.mashape.com/igdbcom/internet-game-database/">their API</a> <a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/summer-update">this summer</a>.  And while I cannot tell the differences to version 1, version 2 is  claimed to be faster, more stable and ready for heavy-weight usage. The  interesting thing here <a href="https://market.mashape.com/igdbcom/internet-game-database/pricing">is the pricing</a>, which reveals that free use of the API is limited to 7,000 requests per day, which is rather not much. Also, IGDB's <a href="https://www.igdb.com/advanced_search">advanced search feature</a> has been rewritten, and is now an even more powerful tool that is among  the leaders of the pack.&nbsp;A feature that usually perfectly showcases the  weaknesses embedded into the current models of genre definition, is an  automated similar games search. The IGDB developers introduced this  nonetheless, but also added the possibility for the users to add their  own recommendations. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/apprentice/similar">recommendations page for the 1990's game Apprentice</a> for an example.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />The  IGDB guys started a new interesting feature series called "Industry  Insight",too, where members of the gaming industry get a voice. Be sure  to <a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-1">check</a> <a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-2-robert-stoneman">out </a><a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-3-anna-bouveng">the </a><a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-3-anna-bouveng"> </a><a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-4-collin-bishop">first </a><a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-4-collin-bishop"> </a><a href="https://www.igdb.com/blog/igdb-dot-com-industry-insight-episode-number-5-doom49">issues</a>. Then they gathered all there is to say about IGDB itself on a single <a href="https://www.igdb.com/about">About page</a>,  amongst the information the interested user can find the IGDB Manifesto  and the current database statistics. And those busy bees also ditched  another missing feature from their ToDo list again, a <a href="https://www.igdb.com/reviews">review aggregator</a>.  Now, there's dozens of critic's reviews calculated together to give the  users a glimpse of a game's quality. Another interesting thing added is  a <a href="https://www.igdb.com/events">page about gaming events</a>,  which gives a nice overview about where to meet other gaming maniacs.  And finally, if you wanna know what the IGDB algorithms think you could  like on the site, just visit their <a href="https://www.igdb.com/feed">personal user feed</a>. Of course, over the last months countless bugs were fixed, too, and many small tweaks to the pages have been made.<br /><br />It's good to see the <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/changelog/2016">on-going progress</a> to renovate the <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/">MobyGames </a>code. Lots of small and bigger changes have made their way onto the site since the last update, here's the short list:<br /><ul><li>When  I was an active contributor at Mobygames, we all thought that hell  would freeze over before the site's data would become accessible via an  API, but we were wrong. The Moby developers <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,4/dgm,231400/">released </a>the first alpha version of <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/info/api">their API some</a> time ago, so the gigantic data masses there can soon be accessed in better ways. Let's see what will become of this!</li><li>Since June, MobyGames <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,227081/">accepts</a> submissions of promotional images for games. There's so much image work  done for promotional purposes: Neatened-up screenies, wall papers,  concept art, etc., and all of these can now be archived at MG. This new  feature seems to be received well, as there's been 100K of such images <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,231659/">contributed till October 20th</a> already. And the site owners seem to like promo images, too, as they <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,231893/">released screenshot scrapers </a>for some popular stores in the net.</li><li>The developers <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,229300/">introduced </a>the  possibility of auto-approval for some database items like game sites,  company logos, game ad blurbs, developer portraits, and Critic Scores.  And the plan is to add more. Moby owner Simon Carless describes this  change as a "much-needed change (which includes auditing so we can check  the auto-approved items)", thus the site "can catch up on the queues  that were months behind, &amp; concentrate on helping new users &amp;  approving more complex items - while still keeping quality high." I'm  sure not everyone will agree with this assessment, as the rumors of an  overall drop in quality won't fall silent with it.</li><li>The Moby contributors celebrated <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,227376/">20K database entries</a> for the Windows platform, which is quite a lot.</li><li>The game catalogue for the Game.com <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,228092/">seems to have reached </a>completion.</li><li>Moby contributor vedder released his database visualization again for 2016. Take a look at it <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,233233/">here</a>.</li></ul>And on January 1st, 2017, the Mobygames owners <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/forums/dga,2/dgb,3/dgm,233333/">revealed their plan</a> to re-write the Moby code-base. Long-time contributors will shake in  fear at this news, as the former owners nearly killed the site with such  an undertaking. But hope dies last, that the current people in charge  have carefully read <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">this article</a>.<br /><br />Our friends at <a href="http://www.retrocollect.com/">RetroCollect </a>posted <a href="http://www.retrocollect.com/News/retrocollect-video-game-database-preview-scope.html">another update</a> on their big database redesign. This time it's about the future scope  of the project. Unsurprisingly, the approach to the scope of covered  data is bold, as the future RC shall cover ~everything. Highlights of  this announcement include a shift from the back-office packing of new  data into the database, then releasing rather complete data sets to the  public, to user-contributed content. Furthermore, users will be able to  check if their copy of a game is already part of one of the preservation  efforts that are taking place. Preservation is an important part of the  retro games movement, so this new feature, unseen anywhere else, is a  good step in the right direction. RetroCollect will also become a  magazine database in the future, which seems like a natural step because  magazine scores are already supported. In <a href="http://www.retrocollect.com/News/retrocollect-video-game-database-update-nintendo-ds.html">other news</a>, RC also added a library of Nintendo DS/DSi games to their database.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/">Giant Bomb</a> turned eight years old in July 2016, big congratulations to whomever feels responsible for that! :) Before this anniversary, the GB engineers <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/wcarle/blog/wiki-beta-v02/113158/">released the next beta version</a> of their new Wiki system (using <a href="http://comicvine.gamespot.com/">Comic Vine</a> data), where they implemented editing of nearly all entities. Check out the feature video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XCnggFyC8">here</a>. At E3 last year, GB editor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5h9q30/im_austin_walker_the_editor_of_vices_gaming_site/">Austin Walker</a> <a href="http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/vice-austin-walker-giant-bomb-1201797909/">announced his departure</a> to create a new dedicated gaming site for <a href="http://www.vice.com/">Vice</a>. This new project is part of Vice's <a href="http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/vice-6-verticals-20-tv-channels-newfronts-1201768418/">agressive expansion strategy</a>. Also, it is now possible to use GiantBomb on Amazon's Fire TV, using the beta version of the <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/amazon-fire-tv-app-the-giant-bomb-enthusiast-app-b-1804117/#3">Giant Bomb Enthusiast App</a> , and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/bug-reporting-33/roku-app-not-working-use-the-beta-version-1808125/">on the Roku </a>set-top box, and on <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/forums/xbox-windows-10-app-the-giant-bomb-video-player-no-1809245/#1">Microsoft devices</a>, and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/introducing-video-bomb-a-new-unofficial-android-ap-1810618">on Android</a>. The developers also launched <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/wcarle/blog/new-video-player-released/114075/">a new embedded video player</a>, and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/bug-reporting-33/video-problems-including-rokuchromecastetc-get-in--1806787/#36">continue to</a> i<a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/wcarle/blog/new-on-giant-bomb-continue-watching/114790/">mprove it</a>, which has some interesting features, the majority of them even for non-premium users. There's even <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/wcarle/blog/new-api-endpoints-for-video/114691/">some API support</a> for videos.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cpc-power.com/">CPC Power</a> celebrated their 10th anniversary in April 2017, congratulations to them!<br /><br /><a href="https://videogamegeek.com/">VideoGameGeek</a> now allows cover mounts and type-in games <a href="https://videogamegeek.com/thread/1593597/cover-tapes-and-discs-aka-magazine-games-now-eligi">to be entered</a> into their database. And the Amiga CD32 finally <a href="https://videogamegeek.com/thread/1736964/platform-sugestion-amiga-cd32-added">made the platform list</a> there.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.ggdb.com/">GGDB</a> is currently down, let's see if it will come back.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/">Home Of The Underdogs</a> continued the quest to clean up their old-world data, meanwhile  reaching letter D of their "Top Dogs" category. Also, they added links  to the <a href="http://www.replacementdocs.com/">ReplacementDocs </a>project where applicable.<br /><br />The Italian database <a href="http://www.uvlist.net/">UVL </a><a href="http://www.uvlist.net/forum/thread/106839">added </a><a href="http://www.uvlist.net/">some </a><a href="http://www.uvlist.net/forum/thread/107438">new platforms</a><a href="http://www.uvlist.net/"> to their count, namely these:</a><br /><ul><li>Unix</li><li>BSD</li><li>Minix</li><li>Solaris</li><li>Exidy Sorcerer (1978)</li><li>Camputers Lynx (1983)</li><li>Memotech MTX (1983)</li><li>Tatung Einstein (1984)</li><li>Amstrad PCW (1985)</li><li>NeXTSTEP (1989)</li><li>Ouya (2013)</li><li>Nintendo Switch (2017)</li></ul><a href="http://www.vgmuseum.com/">The Video Game Museum</a> has two interesting new features about warning screens and messages for consoles. One feature is called "<a href="http://www.vgmuseum.com/features/warn2/">TurboGrafx CD / TurboGrafx-16 / Sega CD WARNING messages</a>", the second one documents Gameboy Color / Neo Geo Pocket Color / WonderSwan Color games <a href="http://www.vgmuseum.com/features/warn/">shoved inside their monochromatic predecessors</a>. Once there, one should also checkout the <a href="http://www.vgmuseum.com/features/sgb/">Super Game Boy borders section</a> which is also content that is likely to be found nowhere else.<br /><br />Let's take a look at some projects that are new in monitoring:<br /><ul><li>A first look at the five databases that the Australian company <a href="http://www.dbolical.com/">DBolical</a> is offering to the gaming world reveals some beautiful gaming data to explore:<ul><li><a href="http://www.gamefront.com/">GameFront</a> is the <a href="http://www.gamefront.com/groups/gamefront/news/we-have-acquired-gamefront">newest</a><a href="http://www.gamefront.com/groups/gamefront/news/rebuilding-filefront">&nbsp;addition</a> to DBolical's portfolio. This site is a massive database and download  site for game files. The content spans from full versions, patches,  demos&nbsp; over to tools, trailers, music, maps, and whatnot. If it's a file  and if it's gaming-related, it can probably be found there now or in  the future.</li><li><a href="http://www.indiedb.com/">Indie DB</a> is a  portal for independent game developers to present their work and get in  touch with players. By supporting the indie community, the database has  acquired information about close to 30K games by now. The latest  additions to the site are <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/groups/indiedb/news/widgets-everywhere-and-v5">download widgets</a> to embed into other sites, the possibility for developers to host <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/groups/indiedb/news/announcing-indie-db-giveaways">game giveaways</a>, and a <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/groups/indiedb/news/sell-your-game-on-dbolical">price comparison</a> feature.</li><li><a href="http://www.moddb.com/">Mod DB</a>,  which is the original site that started the DBolical story, describes  itself as the "largest website dedicated to supporting independent  development of games (user generated game content), including mods,  addons and DLC." At the time of this writing, the site contains  information about many thousands of game modifications, addons, total  conversions, and also about over 650 game creation engines.</li><li>The other two sites in the DBolical portfolio are <a href="http://www.slidedb.com/">Slide DB</a> and <a href="http://www.vrdb.com/">VRDB</a>.  Both sites are similar in scope to Indie DB, where Slides DB aims at  mobile developers, and VRDB tries to make an impact into the world of  virtual reality games.</li></ul></li><li>The <a href="http://psxdatacenter.com/PSX%20Datacenter%20site.html">PlayStation DataCenter</a> has the goal of documenting every PS game there is. Currently, there are three dedicated sites there for the <a href="http://psxdatacenter.com/sitenews.html">PS1</a>, <a href="http://psxdatacenter.com/psx2/sitenews2.html">PS2</a>, and the <a href="http://psxdatacenter.com/psp/sitenews.html">PSP</a>. The site features detailed information about thousands of releases with <a href="http://twitter.com/psxdatacenter">regular updates</a>, and its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PSXDatacenter/videos">Youtube channel</a> with many game play videos.</li><li>The <a href="http://www.gametdb.com/">GameTDB</a><a href="http://www.gametdb.com/Main/FAQ">&nbsp;describes itself</a> as a wiki-style "Titles DataBase: a collaborative database of games for  anyone to contribute and anyone to use in any game-related project.",  and is obviously aimed to be a basis for emulator frontends, native game  browsers, or collection trackers. The whole database can be downloaded  and used without registration, for use on a website permission is  required, though. Currently, there is coverage of Wii, Wii U, gameCube,  3DS, and the PS3.</li><li>An interesting project is the <a href="https://www.hobbydb.com/">hobbyDB</a>,  whose users are "building a giant database of every collectible ever  made – from diecast cars to action figures to comic books to  corkscrews." Of course, video games are collectibles, too, so they <a href="https://www.hobbydb.com/catalog_items/keyword_type_search?catalog_item_type_id=21">can be entered there</a> with a rather detailed set of data attached to it. Furthermore, the  first big bunch of data objects for video games was obviously imported  from <a href="http://en.hugada.net/">HUGADA</a>, which is another project monitored here, as over 27K of the 28K database entries <a href="https://www.hobbydb.com/users/12172">come from there</a> and HUGADA founder Klaus Brandhorst is the video game expert at hobbyDB's <a href="http://info.hobbydb.com/advisory-board/">Advisory Board</a>.</li><li>While <a href="http://www.elisoftware.org/">Eli's Software Encyclopedia</a> seems to have been abandoned quite some time ago, it still holds much  valuable information about classic video game releases. For instance,  check out the hundreds of releases listed for <a href="http://www.elisoftware.org/index.php?title=Category:Apple_Macintosh_Software">Apple Macintosh</a> or <a href="http://www.elisoftware.org/index.php?title=Category:Commodore_64_Software">Commodore 64</a>. Or did you know the 1994 multi-platform edutainment release <a href="http://www.elisoftware.org/index.php?title=Tchaikovsky%27s_1812_%28PC_and_Mac,_CD-ROM%29_Future_Vision_Multimedia_-_1994_USA,_Canada_Release">Tchaikovsky's 1812</a>?</li><li><a href="http://thegamesdb.net/">TheGamesDB.net</a>&nbsp; seems like a promising, eye-pleasing project with some 40K database entries, a <a href="http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php/API_Introduction">first version of an API</a> available (that even seems to be in use by <a href="http://thegamesdb.net/showcase">some software projects</a>), and a <a href="http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php/Release_Milestones">clear development plan</a>. However, the admin <a href="http://forums.thegamesdb.net/topic/156/new-servers">posted a note</a> at Christmas that the site will be migrated to some faster servers over  the year change, but this doesn't seem to be finished, as I was unable  to delve deeper into the data due to time-outs and database errors.  Let's see next time if something improved!</li><li><a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/">RF Generation</a> is another <a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/PHP/about.php?action=stats">rather big</a> game database and community online since 2004. The primary feature of this project seems to be <a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/cgi-bin/collection.pl">collection tracking</a>,  where users can select from&nbsp; over 113K database entries to add to their  collection, where a database entry seems to be a game release or piece  of hardware, thus the huge number. There's even <a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/PHP/checklists.php">collection checklists</a>,  a feature I did not see elsewhere until now. The interested reader can  get a glimpse of the site's data model complexity reading through their <a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/PHP/about.php?action=policies;id=3">game submission guidelines</a>. Users can also use the site's infrastructure to maintain <a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/blogs/browse.php">their own blog</a>, and participate in a <a href="http://www.rfgeneration.com/forum/index.php">lively message board</a>.</li><li>Another site that <a href="http://spong.com/about">wants to become</a> the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> for video games is <a href="http://spong.com/">SPOnG</a>. The database of this <a href="http://spong.com/about/services">rather commercial</a> project already features over 40K entries and an <a href="http://spong.com/search/advanced">acceptable</a> data complexity. Check out the pages for <a href="http://spong.com/game/11044675/Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-PC">GTA IV</a> or <a href="http://spong.com/game/11029240/Doom-III-PC">Doom III</a> for a glimpse. There's also some editorial content such as <a href="http://spong.com/reviews/latest">reviews </a>and other <a href="http://spong.com/features/latest">features </a>offered.</li><li>The first Brazilian project on our monitoring list is the <a href="http://www.vgdb.com.br/">Video Game Data Base</a>, or VGDB. From what I could gather using the Google Translator, this project is aimed at consoles only, documenting <a href="http://www.vgdb.com.br/consoles">hardware </a>and <a href="http://www.vgdb.com.br/jogos/">software </a>alike. Check out the pages for the <a href="http://www.vgdb.com.br/consoles/mega-drive/">Mega Drive</a> and <a href="http://www.vgdb.com.br/mega-drive/jogos/battletoads/">Battle Toads</a> as examples. The data model shown on the game pages is rather simple,  the focus seems to be more on collecting YouTube links with playthroughs  for every game, as many game pages feature these. Unsurprisingly, the  VGDB also has its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vgdbbr">YouTube channel</a>.</li><li>As the name suggests, the <a href="http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/">Acorn Electron World</a> collects everything about this British home computer. Using their own  words, the project is "an electronic collection of everything that was  ever produced for the Acorn Electron. This web site showcases libraries  of <a href="http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/profs/electron/top_lvl.html">professional</a> and <a href="http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/pdworld/electron/top_lvl.html">public domain</a> software, <a href="http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/companions/electron/top_lvl.html">companion discs</a>, articles, instructions, reviews, screenshots, solutions and <a href="http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/c-help.html">game help</a>.".  And as the first project I ever saw, the people behind AEW consider the  database to be completed, as in having everything about the Electron  archived. Hats off, if this is true!</li><li>The people behind the Acorn Electron World also maintain the <a href="http://www.dragon32universe.info/">Dragon 32 Universe</a>, which also has the goal of "building a <a href="http://www.dragon32universe.info/library.html">library of all the software for the Dragon 32 computer</a> and archiving it for future generations.". As regards games, they seem to have completed their goal by ~91%, which is great.</li><li>The goal of the <a href="http://www.handheldmuseum.com/">Handheld Games Museum</a> is to "document (primarily photographically) every electronic handheld  game made in the late 1970's to the mid 1980's.". The site seems to not  have been updated since 2014, but nonetheless offers a wide variety of  pictures of handheld electronic games.</li><li>The <a href="https://lgdb.org/">LGDB </a>(Linux Game Database) is - to no surprise - a crowd-sourced database for Linux games, which offers information about ~<a href="https://lgdb.org/game_index">2050 games</a> at the time of this writing. The goal of the site is not to collect as  much games as possible, but to "list interesting games, that are likely  to be played and are a valuable asset to the Linux gaming community".  This project is definitely worth checking out for Linux gamers, it  offers an acceptable data complexity within its modern design.</li><li>The project <a href="http://www.system16.com/">System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a> offers information about Arcade machines, namely hardware and games  alike. Check out the page for the joint Namco/Sega/Nintendo board <a href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=545">Triforce</a> to get a glimpse of the site's content.</li><li>The <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/">IFDB</a> (Interactive Fiction Database) solely focuses on the IF genre, which  could also be described as "adventuring by reading and typing". The site  lists around 8,500 games by now, and offers strong community features  around its database. User reviews, user game lists, playlists and  wishlists, and polls among them. The data complexity is also satisfying,  check out the entry for <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=xe6kb3cuqwie2q38">Planetfall </a>to get an impression.</li><li>Another  game genre with a humongous library is the Visual Novel, which could be  described as eye-pleasing Interactive Fiction, but with little  interactivity. The main site dedicated to this genre is the <a href="https://vndb.org/">VNDB</a> (Visual Novel Database).
