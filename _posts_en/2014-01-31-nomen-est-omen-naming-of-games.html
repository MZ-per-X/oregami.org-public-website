One of the main recurring criticisms of MobyGames - despite all its  serious flaws in other parts of their data model - is the naming of the  game entries. As MobyGames is, and always has been, a US project, every  game is only accepted into the database <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/info/standards#Main_Title" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">using its US release title as the "main title"</a>.  Missing that, a release title of other English-speaking countries is  accepted, and only if there's no English title available, the original  title of release is allowed, regardless of origin. When a main title is  found for the game, every other title is only accepted into the database  <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/info/standards#Alternate_Titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as an "alternative title"</a>.<br /><br />There's  one big problem with this approach. It may well be that the rest of the  world doesn't care one bit about the US release title of a game.  Imagine a Japanese player browsing MobyGames, <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/final-fantasy-ii_" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">only to find the fourth entry of the Final Fantasy series listed as "Final Fantasy II"</a>,  just because it was the second FF game released in the US. There must  be a better way to do this, so, let's conduct some research about how  other game sites are approaching this issue, and allow me to introduce  you to the planned Oregami solution. For reference, I will always link  Final Fantasy IV as an example game.<!--more-->

<a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=182" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The German project OGDB</a> uses the original release title as main title, where non-latin titles  need to be transliterated before being accepted into the database. Every  other title can be entered as an alternative title with description,  too. <a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/55527/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheLegacy, which is the oldest German project alive</a>,  accepts every transliterated title of a game into its database. All  these titles are treated more or less equally throughout the whole site,  but that's only possible because there is no game list there, where a  single title would need to be chosen for display. Instead, games are  only found using a search, and the game's detail page displays the title  as main title which the user clicked at.<br /><br />So much for German  projects, let's take a look at another old contender of Italian roots -  the UVL. This project doesn't have so much problems with the titling  issue, as it more or less documents different releases of games.  Exemplary, every platform release of a game gets its own entry there,  which naturally lightens the burden of using the "right" title, because  the case of a game being released under two different names for the same  platform is not that common. Final Fantasy IV is such a case, and as  the US release is a seriously dumbed down version of the Japanese game,  it gets two entries at UVL, <a class="external-link" href="http://www.uvlist.net/game-6369-Final+Fantasy+IV" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one under Final Fantasy IV</a> for the hard release of Japanese origin, and <a class="external-link" href="http://www.uvlist.net/game-6373-Final+Fantasy+II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the other named Final Fantasy II</a> for the "Easy Type" US version. Of course, every of these entries has multiple AKA's, too.<br /><br />Finally, let's take a look at two other US projects, and whether they use the US release title as main title, too. <a class="external-link" href="http://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/releases/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">First thing to look at is GiantBomb</a>,  a newer wiki-style project with a lively community. Okay, Final Fantasy  IV is listed under this name, other games I checked are listed under  their original name as well, so I think we can safely assume that  GiantBomb uses the original title, although I couldn't find this  documented on the site. A nice touch of GB's approach is that every  release can have its own title there. <br /><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://videogamegeek.com/videogame/68488/final-fantasy-iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The second US project to look at is VideoGameGeek</a> which is a follow-up to the successful BoardGameGeek project, and has a  unique text desert kind of approach to displaying data. But the data  complexity is high, and a quick look suggests the same approach to game  naming that GiantBomb has: original title with AKA's and named releases.  But a deeper look into VGG's help pages reveals the concept of a  "primary" title which should be "the name with which the game is best  known. For foreign games, if there is a widely known English name, that  name is preferred, otherwise use the native language name.". The  best-known name? Talk about subjectivity.<br /><br />So, what's the  conclusion? Most sites use the original title as "main" title, so should  Oregami do, too? We don't think so. The whole concept of a "primary"  title for a game is flawed to begin with, as there is no such thing. For  every gamer, the title under which he / she got to know a game is his /  her main title. And that personal main title mostly depends on the  region the player resides in, or the platform he / she played the game  on. Following this insight, Oregami will implement a different model:<br /><br />The  main thing we want to do is to assign multiple titles to a game, but  with additional attributes, like region, language, platform, and so  forth. With these data in the database, we will be able to show every  user his / her appropriate title using the information the user entered  about his / herself. Exemplary, if the user is from the US, we could use  the MobyGames model of displaying the US title. Furthermore, we will  implement a hierarchical fallback of titles, so, following our example,  if the US title of the game isn't present in the database, we could  display the UK one instead, then any other English language title, next  the game's original name, and so forth. Finally, these fallback options  should be customizable by the user.<br /><br />Now, the interested reader may  be inclined to ask how this theory would translate to a Final Fantasy  IV implementation. Well, FF IV would get just a single game entry at  Oregami, but with multiple titles assigned to it, which could look as  follows:<br /><br />

<br />By  the way, the differences between the Japanese initial version and the  US Easytype version are documented elsewhere within the data model, but  this shall be the subject of another blog post.<br /><br />Another facet of  our approach to game titles is to document where and how these game  titles were used. Every release of a game comes with different locations  where a title can be shown, e.g. the front cover of the box, the title  screen of the game, or more exotic ones like the install program. So we  will implement a way to be able to assign game titles to releases, too,  saving its location in the process. Of course, this assignment to a  release shall only take place if the respective title was properly  accepted into the database with a game connection beforehand.<br /><br />With  these facilities in place, we will be able to apply this flexible data  display idea to other parts of the database as well, say platform  naming, or showing every user an appropriate cover, which will enable us  to noticeably improve the Oregami user experience. And this is a goal  very much worthwhile, I think. :-)
