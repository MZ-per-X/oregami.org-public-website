One of the best-known nerd podcasts of Germany is the one produced by "<a href="http://www.die-drei-vogonen.de/" target="_blank">The Three Vogons</a>".<br /><br />Some months ago I was asked to join the Three for a guest interview within their next podcast. Well, how did I respond? YES !<br /><br />Now the <a href="http://www.die-drei-vogonen.de/2013/03/18/folge-65-die-drei-vogonen-und/" target="_blank">new issue of their podcast is online</a>!<br /><br />In the best of habits of <a href="http://www.die-drei-vogonen.de/" target="_blank">"The Three Vogons</a>", the podcast lasts for no shorter than nearly 6 (!) hours. In the category "Deep Thought" (from app. 01:39:00 on) one can listen to my interview which lasts for just under an hour. Subjects: content and history of <a href="http://www.kultpower.de/" target="_blank">Kultpower.de</a>, but also the goals of our project <a href="http://www.oregami.org/" target="_blank">Oregami.org</a>,  the all-new and soon-to-be non-profit online video game database.<br /><br />The guys went deep into the issues and asked intelligent questions. I just hope that my answers made a similar impression, too. :-)<br /><br />If you can listen to German, check it out! And then it would be best to help out with Oregami or Kultpower. Or both. :-)
