<div> A few weeks ago a founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.retrocollect.com/" target="_blank" title="retrocollect.com">retrocollect.com</a>&nbsp;asked  for access to our internal discussion board, where we develop a brand  new game database called "oregami" ("Open register of Game  Information"). My first reaction was like "uh, do you want to steal some  of our nice ideas?". The answer went something like: "Hey, you claim  that you are building a truly open system - doesn't seem to be *that*  open."<br /><br /></div><div> Ouch. Good shot. He was right. <a name='more'></a>How can we claim to build a new "open  game database everybody can help to develop" when we restrict access to  our ideas, discussions, drawings, source code and everything else?<br /><br /></div><div> So what do we do now? </div><div> <ol><li>We are preparing the opening of our <strong>discussion board and our wiki</strong> for the rest of the world. Mostly interesting for German speaking  people, as our existing discussions are in German language, but we will  offer a board for requests in English language as well.</li><li>Up to now our <strong>source code</strong> is placed on a privately  hosted Subversion server. This is obviously only a temporary solution.  In the last months I read a lot of howtos etc about&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29" target="_blank">GIT</a>,  which seems to have many advantages in comparison to CVS and  Subversion. As I am not yet used to GIT as an active SVN/CVS user, I am  keen on some practical experiences with GIT. But I am sure it will work  out. Also nice to see that GIT-hosters seem to offer some SVN-import  mechanisms!</li><li>Before we can finally open up everything we want to be prepared as  good as possible: once we are open and people start looking at our  project, the first impression is very important (if you don't like  something it is unlikely that you will stay or come back). We do not  want to gamble away this chance.<br />In detail this means that we want to: <ol><li>work out a better, <strong>multi-language website</strong></li><li>better <strong>document our source code</strong> and write some how-to's so <strong>new developers</strong> can easily get in</li><li>prepare our source code for the chosen <strong>open source license</strong></li></ol></li></ol></div><div> As you can see, we are totally serious about all this. It would be very  easy to just open up our discussion board and source code without  further preparation, but this fast solution would not be the best we can  do. We want to do it better - better than any project has done before. </div>
