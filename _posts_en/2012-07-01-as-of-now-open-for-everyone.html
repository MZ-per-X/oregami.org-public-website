For some one and a half years now, we 're tinkering around with some  people on our new and ultimate online database for computer and video  games named OReGamI (full name is "Open Registry of Game Information").  Within over 800 forum posts we've already created a large amount of the  very important data model, built the foundation for the coding with Java  and, now, are ready to take the next step: publishing our unfinished work. <br /><br />Why that, you may ask? Because we want everyone of you to take part in  the complete development process of this ambitious project. This can  mean reading into our <a href="http://forum.oregami.org/">forums</a> as often as you want, or sniffing around in  our <a href="https://github.com/oregami/oregami.org">Java code base</a>. <br /><br />And when there's something you wanna tell us regarding our ways, or  wanna comment on a certain issue, just do it! Register at the <a href="http://forum.oregami.org/">forums</a> and  post to the <a href="http://forum.oregami.org/viewforum.php?f=39">public area</a> what's bothering you. If you'd like to join us  and actively take part in the development, you should send some info  about yourself to Sebastian using gene[at]oregami.org. We're always open  for new people, be it gaming experts, programmers, designers or lawyers. <br /><br /><b>We're curious to meet you! </b><br /><br />Some final words: We're German and in order to not introduce an  additional language barrier, we started this project using our native  language. But this is not a <i>Sauerkraut project</i>. It can't be, because we  wanna document the global history of video games. So, we're slowly  trying to switch to the English language whereever possible. <br /><br />We started by offering the contents of our shiny <a href="http://www.oregami.org/en/homeblog.html" target="_top">new website</a> bilingual.  Substantial information about our project crave for readers.
