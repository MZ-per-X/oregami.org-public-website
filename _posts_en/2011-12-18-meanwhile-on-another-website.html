Well, of course we'll keep an open eye at the rest of the world as we are interested in what happens there.  <br />So, a great looking and promising game-database is going to start in the next months: <a href="http://www.archive.vg/" target="_blank" title="Archive.vg"><b>Archive.vg</b></a><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><img alt="Archive.vg preview" height="339" src="http://www.oregami.org/images/archive_vg_preview.png" width="507" />  <br />They say that they have more than 40.000 games in their database with more than 340.000 pictures connected to them. Nice! <br />During the last weeks you could sign up for a "blue key" which soon will  open up  the blue door (how unexpected). Due to the "tremendous response" this  promotion is now over. If you have been fast enough, this will make you  one of the last  testers for the final version of their website with some special  features. Also a nice idea!  <br />All the best wishes to our competitors! :D
