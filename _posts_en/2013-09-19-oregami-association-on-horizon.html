It is quite hard to believe, but the first  real discussions about the founding of our Oregami association already  took place in January 2012, i. e. some 20 months ago. And founded it is  not, yet! So what were we up to all this time? And why do we want an  association hosting this project at all? A little retrospect shall give  these information, furthermore we want to give a little perspective on  the future.

Caused by the experiences with other  database projects we committed ourselves quite early to one basic  principle for Oregami: maximum independence from individuals. First and  foremost, this principle should be applied to the legal base of the  project, too. The legal manifestations we saw with other game databases  (private, half-commercial, commercial) had, in our opinion, one crucial  disadvantage: all these projects were legally run by a single person or  company, two at the most, which left us with big questions about the  future-proofness of their data. What would happen when this single  person would lose interest, when this single company would be sold or  become insolvent? What future would arise for these projects then?<br /><br />
<br />
If  you think about a solution to this problem, a German association nearly  suggests itself. In contrast to other legal forms of operation there's  many advantages involved here, advantages we listed <a class="external-link" href="http://oregami.org/en/association.html" rel="nofollow">on our association page</a>,  not too long for easier reading. When considered in the context of  independence from individuals, one attribute was of highest importance  to us: a German association, and the Oregami project with it, couldn't  be taken over against the will of the members. Even a sale of the  Oregami data, driven by an eventual wish for personal gain of the  members, would make no sense because every asset of the association  would be bound to its objectives and assignments and, therefore,  the  money couldn't be distributed to the members. Furthermore, a German  association always stays capable of acting because of the possibility to  easily replace board members by election.<br /><br />If we added the German  non-profit status to this legal form of operation, we also would have  done everything we could to pool the financial risk. Donations and  member fees would be tax-deductible for people required to file a German  tax return, and the charter-imposed obligation of spending the  association's assets for its objectives only, combined with a  transparent and mandatorily audited financial accounting, would enable  members and donators to exactly see where their money is headed. This  should build trust, and convince  the people out there not contributing  time and money elsewhere, too. Of course we understand that a German  non-profit association causes a significant administrative burden like  member administration or accounting. But there's just no legal form of  operation without disadvantages out there.<br /><br />Inspired by all these  thoughts, our resident association adept crafted a charter draft for  Oregami's legal base that on one hand incorporates all important rules  from the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.finanzamt.bayern.de/informationen/steuerinfos/Zielgruppen/Vereine/Mustersatzung-fuer-einen-Verein.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sample charter provided by German financial authorities [German]</a> as well as from the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/BJNR001950896.html#BJNR001950896BJNG000702377" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">German Civil Code (BGB) [German]</a>,  but on the other hand renders the subject easily manageable and  graspable. Soon after we assiduously collected and incorporated feedback  from our community, among other things we integrated the digital  lifestyle into our charter (email and chat) and made some of the  wordings even more easier to understand. The next big step was  presenting our charter to the Association Register (approval of possible  entry) and to Financial Authorities (approval of possible non-profit  status). To our knowledge, there's just no German role model for an  association wanting to maintain a non-profit video gaming database as of  yet, so we faced quite some demand for charter changes to fulfill the  slightly outmoded visions of the institutions. But ultimately and  finally, we now have <a href="http://wiki.oregami.org/display/OR/Satzung" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a rule set for our governing organisation [German only, sorry]</a> which can be introduced to the Association Register and which enables us to become a German non-profit.<br /><br />But  what's next? First things first, we will need at least seven people  wanting to meet up for founding our association. We currently plan to  collect <a href="http://wiki.oregami.org/display/OR/Beitragsordnung" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a minimum of 12 Euros a year for member fees [German only, sorry]</a>,  so that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Three people from the  circle of founding members will need to campaign for the managing board,  namely for the functions chairman, substitute chairman, and treasurer.  Furthermore, we will need to identify an auditor. The first elected  board will face the following tasks and challenges:<br /><ol><li>Setting up the association with the Association Register and Financial Authorities</li><li>Setting up member administration (esp. entry form)</li><li>Setting up the online infrastructure for formal meetings of the members and the managing board (safe chat room)</li><li>Opening up a bank and PayPal account</li><li>Setting up financial accounting</li><li>Transfer of the hosting of oregami.org and crafting of a website for the association</li><li>Implementation of the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.transparency.de/Zehn-Informationen.1613.0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">10 transparency criteria of the "Initiative Transparente Zivilgesellschaft" [German only]</a></li></ol>That  may sound like a whole lot of work, but there's no hurry to get it done  and it will be pleasing to finally get things off the ground. We are  definitely looking forward to it, and we will keep you updated about  further developments right here in this blog. Stay tuned!<br /><br /></div>
