<h3 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Intro">Intro</h3>Oregami is designed to become an interactive database for computer and video games, with a similar complexity like the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.imdb.com/" rel="nofollow">Internet Movie Database</a> &nbsp;has for TV and film. Thus, if we talk about Oregami we quickly drift  to our data model - or technical model - and to the statement that this  ominous model shall be better than that of any existing video game  database. But why that? What is a data model, actually, and why the heck  is it not enough for us what <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/" rel="nofollow">MobyGames</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Start/deutsch.html" rel="nofollow">TheLegacy</a> offer?<br /><br />Now  our beloved hobby brings along a real mountain of data: computer and  video games have a title, belong to one or more genres, are published  for different systems in different versions at different times, even in  different countries, and so on and so forth. We want the users to be  able to enter all these data into our database, but that alone clearly  isn't enough. If the user checks a game entry, he / she may exemplary  want to learn the systems it was released on and when. If one visits a  compilation entry the included games shall be visible, and with one more  click every of those game entries must be reachable for more  information. Or which games of a certain genre have been released on a  certain system within a given time frame?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>Such research can only  be conducted if all the data are connected in a senseful way, and this  is where our data model comes into play: The model contains every  possible kind of data that can theoretically arise with computer and  video games - and connects them. And it does so in a way which, in the  best case, will enable us to reproduce every real world case of <a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games" rel="nofollow">40 years of gaming history</a>.Sounds  complicated? It is, if it's done comprehensively, and following we  wanna use a concrete example to show why. We chose the <a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing_%28series%29" rel="nofollow">X-Wing games</a>,  a series of 3D space shooters within the Star Wars universe that saw  releases on DOS, Macintosh, and Windows throughout the 90s. Reading  through the following "stages" the interested reader will be able to  check the data model of his / her respective favourite video game  database on the correct mapping of the X-Wing series.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0sneQ73muhY/UL_L0jJvMUI/AAAAAAAABTs/fVYLldK4rf4/s1600/xw-001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0sneQ73muhY/UL_L0jJvMUI/AAAAAAAABTs/fVYLldK4rf4/s1600/xw-001.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Some X-Wing releases - so similar, but oh so different.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h3 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Stage1"><b>Stage 1</b></h3>In Stage 1 there's groundwork to lay. Every game database should be able to implement these requirements.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level1-1:Allgames,add-onsandcompilationsoftheserieshavetheirowndatabaseentrywithbasicinformation.">Level 1-1: All games, add-ons and compilations of the series have their own database entry with basic information.</h4>That's  the absolute minimum of information a game database should provide.  Following the games of the X-Wing series along with their official  add-ons, there's different video game databases linked to for  demonstration purposes:<br /><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-x-wing" rel="nofollow">X-Wing</a> with <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-x-wing-imperial-pursuit" rel="nofollow">Imperial Pursuit</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-x-wing-b-wing" rel="nofollow">B-Wing</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6444/" rel="nofollow">TIE Fighter</a> with <a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/4109/" rel="nofollow">Defender of the Empire</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=2683" rel="nofollow">X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter</a> with <a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=2684" rel="nofollow">Balance of Power</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.uvlist.net/game-19091-Star+Wars+X+Wing+Alliance" rel="nofollow">Alliance</a><br /><br />Furthermore, a collection of compilations that featured games of the series:<br /><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-x-wing-collectors-cd-rom" rel="nofollow">X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/16669/" rel="nofollow">TIE Fighter Collector's CD-ROM</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-x-wing-trilogy" rel="nofollow">X-Wing Trilogy</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/14545/" rel="nofollow">X-Wing Collector Series</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=compilation&amp;compid=2366" rel="nofollow">The LucasArts Archives Vol. II</a><br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level1-2:Everyentryofagame,add-onorcompilationshowstheplatformsitwasreleasedon.">Level 1-2: Every entry of a game, add-on or compilation shows the platforms it was released on.</h4>The  first two games of the X-Wing series were initially released on DOS,  and saw both later re-releases on Mac and Windows. The last two games  were initial Windows releases that never made it to another platform.<br /><br />A well-arranged view at the platforms offers, exemplary, the OGDB, just take a look at their <a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=2681" rel="nofollow">TIE Fighter page</a>.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level1-3:Thegamesareconnectedwiththeirrespectiveadd-onsandtheotherwayround.">Level 1-3: The games are connected with their respective add-ons and the other way round.</h4>This  level contains the requirement that the info pages of the main games  link to all their add-ons, and reversely the mother games are visible at  every add-on's page. Naturally, we're not talking about manual links in  the description or similar here.<br /><br />For Level 1-3 the OGDB offers examples, too. For instance, at the <a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=2678" rel="nofollow">bottom of the X-Wing page</a> this level is achieved.<br /><br /><h3 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Stage2"><b>Stage 2</b></h3>Every game database taking itself seriously and wanting to be seen as a serious project should have mastered Stage 2.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level2-1:Compilationsareconnectedtoallincludedgames/add-onsandviceversa.">Level 2-1: Compilations are connected to all included games / add-ons and vice versa.</h4>This  level is a follow-up to level 1-3 not without reason, because it's  quite similar. Starting from the compilation page every included game /  add-on should be reachable and the other way round, which means that on  the page of every game /add-on it should be visible that the game is  part of a compilation. And here, we're also not talking about manual  links, of course.<br /><br />Exemplary, the OGDB shall be mentioned, too, here as one can see for instance on the <a class="external-link" href="http://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=compilation&amp;compid=1974" rel="nofollow">page of the Star Wars Collection</a>.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level2-2:Everygame,add-onorcompilationcanbeassignedmultiplereleaseswithdifferentdatalikereleasedate,region,orcoverscanseach.">Level  2-2: Every game, add-on or compilation can be assigned multiple  releases with different data like release date, region, or cover scans  each.</h4>In the video game industry it is common practice, and  that's how it also has been at times of the X-Wing games, that games see  multiple releases. Say localized versions for different countries, or  budget releases, or within compilations, almost every release features a  new packaging, and different goodies for the collector's heart.<br /><br />As an example, the interested reader can study the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/star-wars-x-wing/release-info" rel="nofollow">release information of X-Wing at MobyGames</a>.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level2-3:Foreverygametheuserscancontributetechnicaldetailslikesystemrequirements,supportedperipherals,orintegratedlanguages.">Level  2-3: For every game the users can contribute technical details like  system requirements, supported peripherals, or integrated languages.</h4>Almost  every game released is built on a different engine and, therefore,  brings along very different system requirements. Furthermore, more than  one gameplay mode is often integrated, or multiple peripherals and  screen resolutions are supported. All that should be visible in a good  video game database.<br /><br />For deeper immersion, the technical information <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/star-wars-x-wing/techinfo" rel="nofollow">to X-Wing</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-x-wing-collectors-cd-rom/techinfo" rel="nofollow">to the X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM</a> at MobyGames shall be linked here.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kHMCKfAIw2M/UL_NxHTMGxI/AAAAAAAABT0/xomeTSPMQAM/s1600/screen_orig.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kHMCKfAIw2M/UL_NxHTMGxI/AAAAAAAABT0/xomeTSPMQAM/s1600/screen_orig.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Some screen shots.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h3 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Stage3"><b>Stage 3</b></h3>Finally,  Stage 3 separates the wheat from the chaff. Here, it gets hairy and  complicated, which is why no example links are given. To our knowledge  there is just no game database mastering the following levels.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level3-1:Thedifferentmainversionsofagamearefullydistinguishablefromoneanother.">Level 3-1: The different main versions of a game are fully distinguishable from one another.</h4>At  this level, "main versions" doesn't mean smallish patches, but  significantly changed re-releases of a game like demos, remakes or  extended versions which basically stay the same game as the initial  release. Exemplary, after its initial release on DOS floppy X-Wing was  ported to the TIE Fighter engine, the result was re-released as an  extended CD-ROM version. Later on the game even saw a port to the X-Wing  vs. TIE Fighter engine for Windows (say X-Wing 95) released. Thus, the  game had three main versions released: DOS floppy, DOS CD and Windows,  whereas all these re-releases were part of compilations initially.  Another example is X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter itself, which was bundled to  some compilations as a dumbed-down promotional version called <a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/78870/" rel="nofollow">Flight School</a>.<br /><br />Level  3-1 therefore implies the possibility to label the game's main version  contained within every release. Vice versa this level also means that  for every main version of a game, the database offers a view showing all  releases of that version over the years.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level3-2:Anestedcompilationisconnectedtoitsoriginalgamesandviceversa.">Level 3-2: A nested compilation is connected to its original games and vice versa.</h4>The  careful reader may be inclined to ask: Huh, that's exactly what we had  at level 2-1? No, not exactly. The subtle distinction is the word  "nested". The X-Wing und TIE Fighter Collector's CD-ROMs, being  compilations themselves in bundling the games X-Wing and TIE Fighter  with their respective add-ons, were bundled together as X-Wing Collector  Series later on. A compilation compilation, if you will, or better  called a nested compilation.<br /><br />So, Level 3-2 implies here that on  the information page of the Collector Series the user can see the games  X-Wing and TIE Fighter with add-ons being bundled, and not only in the  description of this nested compilation. The other way round, on the  information page of every of these games and add-ons the user shall see  the re-release within the Collector Series.<br /><br /><h4 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Level3-3:Changesofthetechnicalspecificationsofagamebyanadd-oncanbereproduced.">Level 3-3: Changes of the technical specifications of a game by an add-on can be reproduced.</h4>The first add-on Imperial Pursuit to the first game of the X-Wing series was <a class="external-link" href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/953/" rel="nofollow">released in an additional version</a> not seen very often: after the installation of Imperial Pursuit:  Upgrade Kit the German player could not only enjoy the additional  content in his native language, but also the main game. Further examples  for changes of a game's technical specifications by an add-on are new  graphic modes, or even new gameplay modes, and add-ons that alter the  system requirements.<br /><br />Within Level 3-3 hides the possibility to  show on the information page of the main game X-Wing that it saw a  localized German release, and that this was done using the add-on  Imperial Pursuit: Upgrade Kit.<br /><br /><h3 id="BlogEntry:TheweirdX-WingseriesorWhydowemodeldata?-Extro">Extro</h3>So  much for the weirdness of the X-Wing series which no video game  database known to us fully reproduces. Within Oregami we try to build up  our data model from the ground up in a way that even Stage 3 can be  checked in without much effort. Easy it is not, but it's fun. Because  other kinds of data are featuring many interesting problems, too, which  need to be comprehensively sorted out beforehand to not hit a wall with  the live database later on.<br /><br />Game developers change their gender,  print magazines are released in different versions per issue, and big  gaming companies found, buy, sell, close their branch offices and  subsidiaries as they see fit. If you'd like to join us puzzling these  problems out, or programming it, you are warmly invited to our forums.  Maybe we can then post a new blog entry about the nice, real world of  data out there soon.<br /><br />This was the first cut, a first blog entry  about an aspect of gaming databases at which we want to improve upon  existing projects. Naturally, there are <a class="external-link" href="http://www.oregami.org/en/about-us.html" rel="nofollow">other aspects</a> that shall separate Oregami from the rest of the bunch later on. But  these shall be subject to blog entries in the not too distant future. So  well, dear reader,&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://textfiles.com/100/actung.hum" rel="nofollow">please watchen das blinkenlights</a>!&nbsp;<img alt="(big grin)" class="emoticon emoticon-laugh" data-emoticon-name="laugh" src="http://wiki.oregami.org/s/en_GB/3390/fe254e109a6fb9b541d2f5e2946c3766ed81e099.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/biggrin.png" />
