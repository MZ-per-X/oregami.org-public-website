Some days ago I was able to take part in the latest edition of the  <a href="http://www.spieleveteranen.de/archives/855" target="_blank">Gaming Veterans' Podcast</a> and, thus, was able to chat with some of the  old stagers of German gaming journalism: Heinrich Lenhardt, Anatol  Locker, Winnie Forster and JÃ¶rg Langer may not be known to international  readers, but are quite famous amongst German retro gamers. For the last  years I've had my share of contact with them through my German retro  mag site <a href="http://www.kultpower.de/">Kultpower.de</a> and I can assure you that they're nice guys whose  experience and competence in the games business blow you away every  single time.&nbsp;<br /><br />But this time, I had something to tell to them and to all the listeners out there: What's the gist of our project <a href="http://www.oregami.org/en/homeblog.html" target="_blank">OREGAMI</a>? <br /><br />Here's the digest: <br /><ul><li>we want to give birth to a new, <b>open and comprehensive online database</b>  about everything related to the world of computer and video games.</li><li>we want to found a <b>non-profit association</b> to host the project  organizationally, legally and financially. The details can be found <a href="http://www.oregami.org/en/association.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li>we are actively searching for <b>new team members</b> in order to be able to fulfill our self-created time schedule.</li><li>right now we're looking for <b>Java programmers</b>. More info for hackers are <a href="http://www.oregami.org/en/developer.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li>soonish we will be looking for <b>Law experts</b> to, exemplary, discuss  licensing issues regarding database contents, screen shots, etc.. The  respective discussion  takes place <a href="http://forum.oregami.org/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=32831" target="_blank">here</a> in the forums [German].</li><li>upcoming will be our search for <b>Designers</b> for a cool and fresh, but  usable look of our website. Interested people can show up and discuss  with us right now, too, of course.&nbsp;:-) </li></ul>So well, if you know some German, then listen to the podcast, read  through our open forums, register, partake! If you don't know German,  then skip the podcast and the reading, just register and comment in the  <a href="http://forum.oregami.org/viewforum.php?f=38" target="_blank">English section</a> of our forums. Only together we will be able to tackle  such a huge project.&nbsp;
